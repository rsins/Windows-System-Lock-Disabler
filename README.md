# Windows-System-Lock-Disabler
This script runs on Windows using the VB script runner (wscript). In case you do not have admin rights to change the windows auto lock feature this script can be used to emulate a keyboard event (scroll lock toggle) to block windows from locking the syste.

Simply double click on the script file or you can assign a keyboard shortcut too to start the script. While running it provides an UI using Internet Explorer in which user has options to "Pause" or "Cancel" the script.

It has mostly been tested on Windows 7.
